<h2 id="about">About</h2>
         <p>This website is a curated collection of resources related privacy and sharing in health research. Our aim here is to provide useful information for someone trying to include open science practices in the design of a biomedical research study that involves personal health information collected from people. I asked several thought leaders to recommend a few of their favorite resoures and to include at least one item from their own relevant work. The end result will be a curated educational resource, organized by contributor and by topic</a>.
      </p>

      				<li>
      					Future Privacy Forum's new <a href="https://fpf.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/FPF_Visual-Guide-to-Practical-Data-DeID.pdf">Visual Guide to Practical Data De-Identification</a>

		<li><strong><u>Fun Facts</u></strong>:
      			<ol>
      				<li>
					A recent study exploring Parkinson's disease gave participant two choices for sharing their data, either (a) share data only with the research team or (b) share data with ALL qualified researchers worldwide. Out of the first ~16,000 enrolled participants, >60% chose to share their data with ALL researchers worldwide. Wow. The <a href="https://sagebionetworks.jira.com/wiki/display/BRIDGE/Bridge+Status">ongoing statistics around sharing are published</a> by Sage BioNetworks. It will be interesting to see if the trend toward broad sharing holds over time. A <a href="http://hdexplore.calit2.net/attitudes-about-personal-health-data/">report by the Health Data Exploration project</a> showed that sharing preferences often depends on the type data (GPS, genetic, activity, etc).
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		
		<li><strong><u>Debates</u></strong>: 
      			<ol>
      				<li>
					Generally, I am in the same camp as people when they say that they should "own their data" much like <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/26/us/politics/president-obama-weighs-in-on-data-from-genes.html?_r=0">U.S. President Barack Obama</a> said at one of the Precision Medicine Initiative events. However, as legal scholar Barbara Evans points out, <a href="http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/articles/pdf/v25/25HarvJLTech69.pdf">treating data like property is not as legally sound as you might think</a>, even if it is a seemingly nifty mental model for expressing the desire for some control over one's own personal data.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li><strong><u>Toolkits</u></strong>: 
      			<ol>
      				<li>
					John Wilbanks has been innovating in the backwater of research governance that is informed consent. The consent form, as John likes to say, is "written by a doctor, edited by a lawyer, and approved by a committee" (as such, doomed to mediocrity). The participant has gotten short shrift, until now. Check out his <a href="http://sagebase.org/platforms/governance/participant-centered-consent-toolkit/">Participant-Centered Consent Toolkit</a> and find some great ways to instantly improve the process of informed consent in your study.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li><strong><u>Nomenclature</u></strong>: 
      			<ol>
      				<li>
					It is incredibly odd to me that most of the biomedical research enterprise operates with the expectation that people should altruistically give up their privacy around data that they themselves don't have access to. There is a relatively small (but growing!) band of researchers who are trying a different approach: give the participants acccess to their own slice of data. The idea that participants in research are given rights to access data about them being held by the researchers is what I call <strong>"equal access."</strong> My feeling is that sometimes good ideas don't catch on until we have good terminology. I hope this idea, if not the term, catches on. 
				</li>
		
			</ol>
		</li>		
		<li><strong><u>Classic Cases</u></strong>: 
      			<ol>
      				<li>
					Danish researchers publicly released data from dating site, OK Cupid, without permission from users. An instant classic of how not to behave as a researcher. See summary of the case in the <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/debug/okcupid-user-data-researchers/">Daily Dot</a>
				</li>

		
      				<li>
					Typically, re-identification is about the threat of third parties being able to identify anonymous participants. In one recent case, a participant was able to <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/05/cholesterol-study-volunteer-unsettling-discovery-science-paper-herself">identify a sketch of her own profile</a> while reading a news article about a research study she volunteered for.

					Data sharing requires more than good data protection! A British study on public attitudes to commercial access to health data found that besides data protection, other important concerns for people were trustworthy institutions, and whether or not personal data are used to create public value: <a href="http://www.bionews.org.uk/page_641989.asp">http://www.bionews.org.uk/page_641989.asp</a>

      			<ol>
      				<li>
					Many people want to share their data to support research, to help other people, or contribute to the common good in other ways. In such cases, data sharing is an enactment of solidarity. We developed a governance framework that is particularly suited to cases of data sharing motivated by solidarity. Key elements are a consent process where potential data sharers learn about the mission and values of the organisation that uses their data (or facilitates data sharing) and where there is transparency also about commercial stakes and interests. Other elements are that people retain access to their own data, and have access to findings. The solidarity-based approach also envisages the establishment of harm mitigation funds in cases where people who share data solidaristically could be harmed by the use of these data. Further details on solidarity-based data governance can be <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2834563">found here.</a> .

      		<li><strong><u>Educational guide:</u></strong> 
      			<ol>
      				<li>Guidance on the deidentification is, by necessity, abstract. But recent guidance documents produced by the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/coveredentities/De-identification/hhs_deid_guidance.pdf">Department of Health & Human Services</a> and by the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/1061/anonymisation-code.pdf">United Kingdom’s Information Commissioner’s Office</a> do a better job than most explaining what types of factors and qualities make data more likely to attract a reidentification attack, and more vulnerable to an attack once attempted.

      			<ol>
      				<li>The public controversy over Facebook’s secret research spilled into the policy sphere: Is consent and IRB review the right model? Many perspectives were captured in <a href="http://ctlj.colorado.edu/?page_id=238">this symposium issue</a> of the Colorado Technology Law Journal. And my own perspective, which is highly skeptical of both consent and IRB review (favoring risk-based regulation of research instead), <a href="http://luc.edu/media/lucedu/law/students/publications/llj/pdfs/vol47/issue2/J. Bambauer.pdf">is available here</a>.
      				</li>
      			</ol>
      		</li>

      		<li><strong><u>Debates:</u></strong> 
      			<ol>
      				<li>As for the debate about reidentification risk and open data, in addition to the excellent resources provided by others, I recommend Felix Wu’s work on the subject, <a href="http://lawreview.colorado.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/13.-Wu_710_s.pdf">Defining Privacy and Utility in Data Sets</a>, and Khaled El Emam et al., <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0028071">A Systematic Review of Re-Identification Attacks on Health Data</a>.
      				
<br /><br />When data has been deidentified, reidentification attacks can be overwhelmed with false matches—a fact that is often overlooked in the popular press. Three examples are available <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277572042_Intruder_Testing_on_the_2011_UK_Census_Providing_Practical_Evidence_for_Disclosure_Protection">here</a> (matching attacks correct at most 47% of the time), <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261452742_Exploring_re-identification_risks_in_public_domains">here</a> (matching attacks correct 5-63% of the time), and <a href="http://www.ehcca.com/presentations/HIPAAWest4/lafky_2.pdf">here</a> (only two out of twenty-eight reidentifications were correct).

<br /><br />The sense of risk is also exaggerated when uniqueness within a deidentified database is used as an estimate for reidentification risk, and when bad anonymization techniques are used as a representation of all anonymization techniques. Compare <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/347/6221/536.full">this paper published in Science</a> (concluding that credit card data cannot be safely anonymized) to <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6279/1274.1.full">this critique</a>, also published in Science (pointing out the uniqueness and straw man problems).

<br /><br />Full disclosure: I am a partisan in this debate. I have argued that the moral imperative points toward, rather than away from, publicly accessible deidentified databases in <a href="http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/articles/pdf/v25/25HarvJLTech1.pdf">Tragedy of the Data Commons</a>. In more recent <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2795808">experimental work</a>, I found that consumers do not seem to care about reidentification risk (whereas they do care about the sale of data to pharmaceutical companies).

<h3 id="topic-3">Debates</h3>

      	<ul>
		<li><u>Owernship of Data</u>: Jason Bobe says, "Generally, I am in the same camp as people when they say that they should "own their data" much like <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/26/us/politics/president-obama-weighs-in-on-data-from-genes.html?_r=0">U.S. President Barack Obama</a> said at one of the Precision Medicine Initiative events. However, as legal scholar Barbara Evans points out, <a href="http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/articles/pdf/v25/25HarvJLTech69.pdf">treating data like property is not as legally sound as you might think</a>, even if it is a seemingly nifty mental model for expressing the desire for some control over one's own personal data."</li>
		</li>
      		<li><u>De-identification and re-identification</u>, see: <a href="http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&context=hightechevents">"Broken Promises of Privacy"</a> (anti-de-id) and also the <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/hmd/~/media/Files/Activity%20Files/Environment/EnvironmentalHealthRT/2014-03/Daniel-Barth-Jones_March2014.pdf">pro de-id side</a>.
      		</li>
      		<li><u>Sharing Clinical Trial Data</u>: For a "full-throated defense of sharing clinical trial data without gatekeepers" Misha recommends <a href="http://www.vinayakkprasad.com/other-writing/">Vinay Prasad's writing</a> -- a response to NEJM's infamous editorial on <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe1516564#t=article">"research parasites"</a> and subsequent commentary</li>

      		<li>Many people want to share their data to support research, to help other people, or contribute to the common good in other ways. In such cases, data sharing is an enactment of solidarity. We developed a governance framework that is particularly suited to cases of data sharing motivated by solidarity. Key elements are a consent process where potential data sharers learn about the mission and values of the organisation that uses their data (or facilitates data sharing) and where there is transparency also about commercial stakes and interests. Other elements are that people retain access to their own data, and have access to findings. The solidarity-based approach also envisages the establishment of harm mitigation funds in cases where people who share data solidaristically could be harmed by the use of these data. Further details on solidarity-based data governance can be <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2834563">found here.</a> .

 <h3 id="topic-6">Fun Facts</h3>


      		<ul>
		<li>A recent study exploring Parkinson's disease gave participant two choices for sharing their data, either (a) share data only with the research team or (b) share data with ALL qualified researchers worldwide. Out of the first ~16,000 enrolled participants, >60% chose to share their data with ALL researchers worldwide. Wow. The <a href="https://sagebionetworks.jira.com/wiki/display/BRIDGE/Bridge+Status">ongoing statistics around sharing are published</a> by Sage BioNetworks. It will be interesting to see if the trend toward broad sharing holds over time. A <a href="http://hdexplore.calit2.net/attitudes-about-personal-health-data/">report by the Health Data Exploration project</a> showed that sharing preferences often depends on the type data (GPS, genetic, activity, etc).
		</li>
		<li>
					Data sharing requires more than good data protection! A British study on public attitudes to commercial access to health data found that besides data protection, other important concerns for people were trustworthy institutions, and whether or not personal data are used to create public value: <a href="http://www.bionews.org.uk/page_641989.asp">http://www.bionews.org.uk/page_641989.asp</a>

<h3 id="topic-7">Nomenclature</h3>


      		<ul>
		<li><u><strong>Equal Access</strong></u>: It is incredibly odd to me that most of the biomedical research enterprise operates with the expectation that people should altruistically give up their privacy around data that they themselves don't have access to. There is a relatively small (but growing!) band of researchers who are trying an approach that is new and different: give the participants acccess to their own slice of data, if they want to inspect it. The idea that participants in research are given rights to access data about them being held by the researchers is what I call <strong>"equal access."</strong> My feeling is that sometimes good ideas don't catch on until we have good terminology. I hope this idea, if not the term, catches on. </li>
