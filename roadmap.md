##Privacy Resource Roadmap

####Goals
A curated educational resource for people who want to design biomedical research studies that practice “open science”. What do they need to know about privacy?

We are surveying thought leaders in privacy and sharing in biomedical research and asking them to list a few of their favorite resources  that would be useful for someone trying to design a biomedical research study that includes open science practice.

The types of things you might include on your list are:
* Written Cases of Interest, e.g. OK Cupid (what not to do)
* Educational Guides, e.g. FPF’s new chart
https://fpf.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/FPF_Visual-Guide-to-Practical-Data-DeID.pdf
* Toolkits, e.g. Participant-Centered Consent Toolkit
* Legal stuff, e.g. something about HIPAA, Common Rule, etc.
* Published articles, e.g. “sharing by design” 
* Tools, e.g. Is it Human Subjects Research?
* Services
* Other stuff you think might be useful

Some people we plan to solicit resources from:
* John Wilbanks (Sage)
* Daniel Barth-Jones
* Madeleine Ball
* Lauren Smith, Future Privacy Forum 
* Barbara Evans, legal scholar
* Ann Waldo, attorney
* Camille Nebeker, UCSD http://thecore.ucsd.edu/
* Misha Angrist, Duke
* Someone from GA4GH -- privacy group
* Mildred Cho, Stanford
* Barbara Prainsack, King’s Colege London
* Jeantine Lunshof, Harvard PGP
* Michelle Meyer
