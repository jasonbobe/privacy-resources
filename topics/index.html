<h2 id="about">Recommended Resources</h2>
      <p>This website is a curated collection of resources related privacy and sharing in health research, intended to be useful for someone trying to design an open science themed biomedical research study. I asked several thought leaders to recommend a few of their favorite resoures and to include at least one item from their own relevant work. The end result is a curated educational resource, organized <a href="http://blog.jasonbobe.net/privacy-resources/">by expert</a> or by topic. Thanks to all the contributors!
      </p>


<h2 id="topic-1">Guides</h2>

      	<ul>
      		<li><u>Guides</u>: Future Privacy Forum's new <a href="https://fpf.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/FPF_Visual-Guide-to-Practical-Data-DeID.pdf">Visual Guide to Practical Data De-Identification</a></li>
		
	</ul>
      </p>


<h2 id="topic-2">Cases</h2>

      	<ul>
      		<li>Danish researchers publicly released data from dating site, OK Cupid, without permission from users. An instant classic of how not to behave as a researcher. See summary of the case in the <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/debug/okcupid-user-data-researchers/">Daily Dot</a></li>
		
		<li>Typically, re-identification is about the threat of third parties being able to identify anonymous participants. In one recent case, a participant was able to <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/05/cholesterol-study-volunteer-unsettling-discovery-science-paper-herself">identify a sketch of her own profile</a> while reading a news article about a research study she volunteered for.</li>
		
      	</ul>

 

<h2 id="topic-3">Debates</h2>

      	<ul>
		<li><u>Owernship of Data</u>: Jason Bobe says, "Generally, I am in the same camp as people when they say that they should "own their data" much like <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/26/us/politics/president-obama-weighs-in-on-data-from-genes.html?_r=0">U.S. President Barack Obama</a> said at one of the Precision Medicine Initiative events. However, as legal scholar Barbara Evans points out, <a href="http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/articles/pdf/v25/25HarvJLTech69.pdf">treating data like property is not as legally sound as you might think</a>, even if it is a seemingly nifty mental model for expressing the desire for some control over one's own personal data."</li>
		</li>
      		<li><u>De-identification and re-identification</u>, see: <a href="http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&context=hightechevents">"Broken Promises of Privacy"</a> (anti-de-id) and also the <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/hmd/~/media/Files/Activity%20Files/Environment/EnvironmentalHealthRT/2014-03/Daniel-Barth-Jones_March2014.pdf">pro de-id side</a>.

      	</ul>

      
 <h2 id="topic-6">Fun Facts</h2>


      		<ul>
		<li><u>Fun Facts</u>: A recent study exploring Parkinson's disease gave participant two choices for sharing their data, either (a) share data only with the research team or (b) share data with ALL qualified researchers worldwide. Out of the first ~16,000 enrolled participants, >60% chose to share their data with ALL researchers worldwide. Wow. The <a href="https://sagebionetworks.jira.com/wiki/display/BRIDGE/Bridge+Status">ongoing statistics around sharing are published</a> by Sage BioNetworks. It will be interesting to see if the trend toward broad sharing holds over time. A <a href="http://hdexplore.calit2.net/attitudes-about-personal-health-data/">report by the Health Data Exploration project</a> showed that sharing preferences often depends on the type data (GPS, genetic, activity, etc).</li>

      			<li>c</li>
      		</ul>

  
<h2 id="topic-7">Nomenclature</h2>


      		<ul>
		<li><u>Equal Access</u>: It is incredibly odd to me that most of the biomedical research enterprise operates with the expectation that people should altruistically give up their privacy around data that they themselves don't have access to. There is a relatively small (but growing!) band of researchers who are trying an approach that is new and different: give the participants acccess to their own slice of data, if they want to inspect it. The idea that participants in research are given rights to access data about them being held by the researchers is what I call <strong>"equal access."</strong> My feeling is that sometimes good ideas don't catch on until we have good terminology. I hope this idea, if not the term, catches on. </li>
